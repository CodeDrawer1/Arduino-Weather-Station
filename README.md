# Arduino-Weather-Station
So all this does is a basic weather station that has an SD card logger, a DHT 22, and a BPM 180 from adafruit.
You will need three libraries to install. Found here.
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-BMP085-Library
and here
https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library
Install these libraries then copy/paste the code to the IDE.
You will need to rename the libraries, I named mine DHT, BPM, and Adafruit_Sensor.
Name the adafruit sensor library the same why I did or else the program won't work.
